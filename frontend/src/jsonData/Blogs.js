Kashmir isn’t just a destination; it’s an emotion. Imagine sailing on a shikara in Dal Lake, skiing in Gulmarg, or walking through the golden meadows of Sonamarg. Every season paints Kashmir in a new shade.

### Srinagar – The Heartbeat of Kashmir
Your journey to Kashmir is incomplete without experiencing Srinagar. Take a Shikara ride on Dal Lake, stay in a houseboat, and visit Mughal Gardens like Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh.

### Gulmarg – The Winter Wonderland
Famous for skiing and the highest Gondola ride. Even in summer, the lush meadows are perfect for picnics.

### Pahalgam – A Scenic Escape
Lush valleys, Lidder River, and the starting point of Amarnath Yatra.

### Sonmarg – The Meadow of Gold
Snow mountains, Sindh River, and Thajiwas Glacier treks.
